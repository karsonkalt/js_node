# What is Node

Node is a JS runtime enviornment
Can run JS on the server, not just in the browser, but anywhere like a normal programming language
Node uses V8 engine, the one built by Chrome.
It is then compiled to machine code.
V8 is written in C++. It adds certain features that are added in C++.

Node adds some features:
- We can access local file systems

## How the Web Works
- Normally we have a user (client), where we pair HTML, CSS, and JS.
- They send a request to the server.
- The server executes some code with the incoming request and returns a response.
- The server sends a response, sometimes a HTML page.

The server validates input, authenticates, access databases, and has all the business logic.

Node.js isn't limited to the server, but is a JS runtime. For local utility scripts and build tools.
We use node.js in React actually, because it's a great tool for utility scripts.
Mostly, though, it is used to server side code.

## What Node.js can do
- With node JS you don't just write the code executed on the server, we actually create the server and listen to requests.
- Handles business logic
- Handles sending a response

## Alternatives
- Ruby on Rails
- Python/Django
- PHP
